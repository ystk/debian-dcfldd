Comment: a note from upstream site -- "dcfldd was written by Nicholas Harbour,
         who at the time was working for the Department of Defense Computer
         Forensics Lab (DCFL). Although he is no longer affiliated with the
         DCFL, Nick still maintains the package. The DCFL does not maintain,
         support, or have any other affiliation with dcfldd."
